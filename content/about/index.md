Work with tech, belive in magic, live on fun :)


Daily work:

- Cloud infrastructure: AWS management, config management/monitoring/alerting/performance tuning.
- Data infrastructure: data warehouse/lake, ETL.
- Build CI/CD pipeline for fast deployment flow.
- Chaos is my friend.

I work with python/golang/js/shell, but always think language is the most trival part in life.
Be professional, write robust code and useful doc.
