# Move to kubernetes

## What traditional IT operations involve (on aws)

- Infrastructure level:
    - vm server
    - DNS
    - Loadbalancer (L4/L7)
    - Persistence storage (ebs/efs)

- application level:
    - configuration management(chef/puppet/salt/ansible ...)
    - CI/CD

The most frustrating part is mapping those two parts.

- which app on which server or group of servers 


## Pain point of traditional way

- Slow to make changes
- Can't take efficent usage of infra resources
- inconsistent of application runetime 

## How k8s changes
